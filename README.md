# PyPassword Generator
This project generates secure random passwords for you based on the number of characters, symbols, and numbers you desire. You can choose between an easy level where the order of characters is not randomized, or a hard level where the order is shuffled for enhanced security.

## Features
- Generate passwords with a mix of letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols.
- Two levels of password complexity:
  - **Easy Level**: Order is not randomized.
  - **Hard Level**: Order is randomized to increase security.
